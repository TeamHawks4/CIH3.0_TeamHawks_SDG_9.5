1.SHAP Analysis (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is an Explainable AI (XAI) technique used to understand how each input feature contributes to a machine learning model’s prediction.

2.AI Matchmaking

AI Matchmaking is an intelligent recommendation process that automatically connects the right people, projects, or resources by analyzing data patterns and compatibility scores using machine learning.

Instead of manual searching, AI evaluates multiple parameters and predicts the best possible matches in real time.

In your platform, AI Matchmaking connects innovators (researchers/startups) with industry funders/investors based on project relevance, domain expertise, funding interests, impact goals, and past success patterns.
